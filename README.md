# RockPaperScissors
This is a OdinProject exercise

Game is working now. It declares the winner of the round and declares the winner of the game, based on who reaches 5 first.

I want to change how the code handles events. I will try to add a global eventlistener.

Next I will make it more responsive, and I will add animations and design elements.
